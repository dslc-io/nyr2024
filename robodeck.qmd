-   I run the Data Science Learning Community, DSLC.io
-   You may know us as R4DS or the R4DS Online Learning Community
-   Started as a book club for R4DS in 2017, but
    -   We've never been affiliated with that book
    -   We cover much more than that one book
    -   Book clubs in R, Python, Julia, and Javascript
    -   Question answering and mentoring
    -   If you want to learn anything about data science, we're here to help.
-   *(load text)* 
-   I want to tell everybody about us & the name change.
-   I don't want to keep giving the same talk.
-   Conferences don't want me to keep giving the same talk.
-   Creating a new talk is hard.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:
```

## You are bad and your ideas are bad.

This empty template is intimidating.
Where do you even start?
Do you really know what you're doing?

## Even worse

You could start with a completely empty deck!

::: notes
-   Starting a new Quarto presentation is hard!
-   I could upgrade this template to include styles and that sort of thing,

-   Slide times won't add up
-   Often won't follow explicit instructions

::: notes
-   It makes a new answer that sounds like what it's supposed to say.
-   Before statisticians get too excited:
-   If the range was larger, it might never score you as correct, because people rarely say "you got it" when the range is large.
-   More practical examples (bullets)
-   Even the latest GPT model will create a talk outline with times included, 
    -   But those times add up to more than the target time.
    -   And then it confidently says that they add up to LESS than the target time.

-   Because they're stupid, we sometimes need to trick them.

-   The OpenAI API is built for back-and-forth chats, but you can lie about what the robot (the "assistant" in the API) said.
-   It didn't actually say this, I just tell it that it said it.

-   Now I say exactly the same thing as when I started.
-   And it does it right most of the time.

-   I love to create R packages,

-   GPTs trained using "reinforcement learning with human feedback," a form of human-in-the-loop machine learning
-   I recommend using the robots in a similar fashion.

  Grolemund, from which we took our original name, the 'R4DS Online Learning
  Community.' That group of learners grew into a diverse, friendly, and inclusive 
  community of over 17,000 data science enthusiasts and practitioners. In this

-   Book clubs across all data science topics, not just R
-   Relevant here: Lots of shiny books.
-   Books and book-like things like online courses and even pkgdown sites.
    -   Just needs to be free (legally) online.
-   The name "R4DS Online Learning Community" became less and less accurate.
-   5-6 is ideal.
    -   (Don't move forward yet)
    -   1-hour weekly meeting
    -   Shared slide decks that we're developing collaboratively
    -   I've worked in educational publishing for about 25 years, sneak in best practices
-   (Next slide) Vids on YouTube, so it's ok to miss a week

üôè Grateful for all contributions

::: notes
-   We're a collective in the Open Collective Foundation, which makes us count as a 501c3 charitable organization for US taxes.
    -   OCF dissolved suddenly last month
    -   Need a STABLE new host by end of this year
-   Even before then we can start working out details of grants and sponsorships!
    -   I don't get paid for any of this yet.
    -   My dream is to work on this full time.
-   We had a fundraiser last month while we still could, and my heart is warmed by the response.
    -   Will let us keep things running, but won't get us all the way to where I envision us going.

# Live demo: {robodeck} in action

[Randomly generated deck](random.html)

::: notes
-   As I walked on stage, I asked Jared for a word.
-   I used a wrapper around robodeck to generate this deck, including images.
-   I have not seen it.
-   Probably do not try this at home, although it might be a fun way to inspire new talks!
-   Let's see what we see!
